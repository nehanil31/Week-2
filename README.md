In Week 2, we implemented a CNN model for image classification using Keras and TensorFlow, achieving 98% accuracy in the 15th epoch. The model consists of three convolutional layers with increasing filters (32 → 64 → 128), followed by max-pooling and dropout layers (0.5) to prevent overfitting. We used Adam optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss for compilation and trained the model for 15 epochs with augmented data from `ImageDataGenerator`. Improvements included enhanced feature extraction with deeper layers, dropout for regularization, data augmentation for better generalization, and tuning batch size and learning rate for improved stability and convergence.
